Application of 3 metaheuristics to solve the maximum clique problem

**Maximum clique problem :**\
The maximum clique problem involves finding the largest subset of vertices in a graph where every pair of vertices is directly connected by an edge. This problem is known to be NP-complete, meaning it is computationally challenging to solve efficiently for large graphs.
