**Definition:**\
The Maximum Covering Problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem.\
The general idea is to select a subset of elements to cover as many elements as possible while respecting given constraints.\
It can be formally defined as follows:\ A finite set U containing n elements (the universe): U = {e1, e2, ..., en}.\
A collection S of m subsets of U: S = {S1, S2, ..., Sm}, where each Si ⊆ U.\
An integer k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ m.\ The objective is to Find a subcollection C ⊆ S consisting of exactly k subsets, such that the total number of elements covered by these subsets is maximized.
